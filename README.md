## Python Tutorial for signal processing 
This tutorial will help you get started using python for doing signal processing work for ELEC-301 case studies, and even doing some cool course projects! 

### Python Installations 
Before you start, you need to set up a working Python environment on your PC. If you are on Mac or Linux system, you might already have a system Python installed. But, for signal processing applications you will need some specific Python packages (numPy, sciPy, matplotlib, and iPython), which are not installed by default. Though it is not at all difficult to install these on your system, we recommend these two approaches for ease, uniformity and predictability in system environments. 

Install on your system Anaconda Python distribution (https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/).  

-or-

Use DataJoy's online scientific python (https://www.getdatajoy.com)

### IPython Notebooks 
The IPython Notebook is an interactive computational environment, in which you can combine code execution, rich text, mathematics, plots and rich media. Anaconda's scientific python distribution comes with the latest version of IPython notebook preconfigured and ready to go! DataJoy is also based around the idea of IPython notebook in the cloud. 

For further details, visit [IPython](http://ipython.org/notebook.html). 

### Working with the tutorials 
All the tutorial files here are actually iPython notebooks which you can directly download and open within your browser-based IPython notebook environment (Anaconda's). You can also copy paste the code from the tutorial to IPython terminal on your system (Anaconda's) or online (dataJoy's). Whatever works best for you!
