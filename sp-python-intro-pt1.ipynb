List slicing follow the general syntax *[start: stop: step=1]* to slice out elements from *start* to *stop-1* with a stride length of *step*. You can omit *start* and *stop* values, and  they will default to the beginning and end of the list respectively. Default value for *step* is $1$, and it can also be ommited. "

Numpy Ndarrays suit ideally for all our signal processing needs, and as they are similar to the native list datatypes, they support same indexing and slicing operations. We will use Ndarrays from now on to model our signals. \n",
