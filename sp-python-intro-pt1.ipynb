This tutorial assumes that you are somewhat familiar with Python (I assume that you are familiar with lists and functions, but not classes and inheritance). You can brush up your Python skills by reading freely available online Python tutorial. We recommend https://developers.google.com/edu/python/lists?hl=en as it is short and sweet! \n",

    "In signal processing, we generally have large number of samples of some signals (e.g. audio signal samples) on which we want to apply some signal processing operator (e.g. convolution, Fourier Transform etc). Before we can apply any operator to our signal samples, we must first store it in memory. In Python, the standard way to store large number of samples in a variable is to use a list data-type, i.e. "

    "### Indexing and slicing\n",
    "Python's **list** data type is versatile. It supports *indexing* to refer to some particular sample in the list. List index runs between $0$ and $N-1$, where $N$ is the length of the list. \n",
    "> Caution! This indexing rule is different from Matlab where indexing starts at $1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lists can be indexed from the end as well. Index $-1$ referes to the last element, index $-2$ second last and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "List *slicing* can be used to extract subparts of a list, and store it in a new list variable. List slicing follow the general syntax *[start: stop: step=1]* to slice out elements from *start* to *stop-1* with a stride length of *step*. You can omit *start* and *stop* values, and  they will default to the beginning and end of the list respectively. Default value for *step* is $1$, and it can also be omitted. "

    "But, Python's lists have some limitations from signal processing perspective.  One prominent limitation is that we cannot directly apply functions like $\\sin$ or $\\exp$ on all the elements of a list without using a  **for** loop list construct (as shown above) every time. As, we will be working with large number of signal samples all the time, it would be much easier if we could directly use something like $\\sin$(lst1) to compute sine of all the elements in the list1.\n",

Numpy Ndarrays suit ideally for all our signal processing needs, and as they are similar to the native list data-types, they support same indexing and slicing operations. We will use Nd-arrays from now on to model our signals. \n",
